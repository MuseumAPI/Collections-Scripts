# Script for Shiny App that pulls from the GBIF API #

Using [rgbif](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgbif/README.html) with [GBIF's API v1.0](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary) currently allows for faceting/summary counts of occurrence-records by collection-code, institution, and year (among other things).

This is a shiny app/test to display those summaries interactively.
