A demo of this script is running [here](http://10.10.10.247:3838/SOLRshiny/)

A semi-functional shiny app to query Field Museum Anthropology, Botany, and Zoology Solr cores.

Query-options include

...filtering record contents by a search string

...faceting records by:

* What (Collection or Taxonomy)

* Where (Country, etc)


The first image among the results is displayed (if any are present)
